# Exercise-1
In this exercise, you'll practice creating a simple react component. In your `main.jsx` file, you'll want to do the following:

- Create a React component called `MyComponent`
- In the `render` function, create two variables `name` and `interest`: set them to your name, and one of your interests
- Then, your `render` function should return a `<div>` with two `<p>` elements in side of it. The first `<p>` should say "Hello, my name is NAME", and the second should say "I am interested in INTEREST". Make sure to _reference your JavaScript variables_
- After you've created your component, you should use `ReactDOM` to render your component in the `main` element on your page
