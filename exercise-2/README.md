# Exercise-2
In this exercise, you'll practice passing props to a simple react component. This is a simple extension of **exercise-1**, except we are passing values into the component via _props_

In your `main.jsx` file, you'll want to do the following:

- Create a React component called `MyComponent`
- Then, your `render` function should return a `<div>` with two `<p>` elements in side of it. The first `<p>` should say "Hello, my name is NAME", and the second should say "I am interested in INTEREST". Make sure to _reference your component props_
- After you've created your component, you should use `ReactDOM` to render your component in the `main` element on your page. Make sure to pass variables into your component as props!


As described in [module-4](https://github.com/info343c-a16/m4-git-intro), start by forking and cloning this repository. Then, DO STUFF
